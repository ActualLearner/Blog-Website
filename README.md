# Beginner Blog Website
SimpleBlogs is a blog website that allows the basic CRUD operations. I built this as a project in Angela Yu's Complete Web development course curriculum.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, NodeJS and ExpressJS

Building this was quite simple. Started with 2 pages, incorporated the backend, and fixed bugs relating to requests & responses.

## Optimizations
This is a beginner project, but thereâ€™s always room for improvement! Some potential optimizations include:

- Database Integration: Replace in-memory storage with MongoDB for a more scalable solution.
- Styling: Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap to enhance the layout and responsiveness.
- Authentication: Add user accounts so only logged-in users can create or manage blogs.
- Deployment: Host the app on a cloud provider like Heroku or Vercel for better accessibility.

## Lessons Learned:
- Feel more comfortable with EJS.
- Better error handling.
- Deeper understanding of request-response cycle.
