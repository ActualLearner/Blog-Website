# Beginner Blog Website
SimpleBlogs is a blog website that allows the basic CRUD operations. I built this as a project in Angela Yu's Complete Web development course curriculum.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, NodeJS and ExpressJS

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
This is a beginner project, but thereâ€™s always room for improvement! Some potential optimizations include:

- Database Integration: Replace in-memory storage with MongoDB for a more scalable solution.
- Styling: Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap to enhance the layout and responsiveness.
- Authentication: Add user accounts so only logged-in users can create or manage blogs.
- Deployment: Host the app on a cloud provider like Heroku or Vercel for better accessibility.

## Lessons Learned:
- Feel more comfortable with EJS.
- Better error handling.
- Deeper understanding of request-response cycle.
